# Automatic Phone Calls in PHP
PHP program that uses Twilio to programmatically call a verified number, speak a custom message and then play a song! This uses TwiML markup for the response.

A demonstration video **video.mp4** is uploaded in this repository. It shows the actual working of the code and how fast it is.

**Note:** The code won't work out of the box as the API keys and phone numbers have been removed for privacy. You need to create a new account and use your own API keys and phone numbers.
